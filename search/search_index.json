Microcontroller Pin Allocation","text":"<p>The project demanded me not to use ESP32, therefore the data relating to esp32 on this document are unrelated.</p> <p>(Find links to ESP32 data in PDF)</p> <p>Description of role in the team: I am working on the sensor. This project was largely inspired by this working example of a weather monitoring system: link. The system will use a 3.3V supply for my part in the team and use I2C communication with the ESP32. I used the I2C communication for a sensor last semester so I am somewhat familiar with how it works, I am starting to familiarize myself with how the PIC18F47Q10 works although not 100% familiar with its software and communication styles, it is something that I am learning in this class. Another problem was that I could not use the DHT11, however, after looking at the datasheet of the DHT11, I found that the only major difference technically between my two devices was that the DHT was more expensive and had a measuring supply current of 980 \u00b5W instead of 220 \u00b5W. This will require me to design the voltage and current supply accordingly by using a low-dropout (LDO) regulator or a buck converter to provide a stable 3.3V supply from the main power source. Additionally, I will verify that the power rail can supply at least the maximum operating current of the sensor, accounting for any potential inrush currents. A current-limiting resistor or a precision power supply with current regulation can help prevent overcurrent damage. Finally, I will confirm proper voltage levels using a multimeter and check signal integrity with an oscilloscope if necessary.</p> <p>Error Checking &amp; Pin Availability</p> <p>Enough Pins? Yes, the PIC has sufficient GPIOs to accommodate all necessary peripherals.</p> <p>Conflicts? I2C and UART do not share pins, ensuring proper communication.</p> <p>Power Requirements? The PIC accepts 3.3V input, which matches the HDC1010YPAR\u2019s voltage requirement.</p> <p>Final Microcontroller Choice &amp; Rationale</p> <p>Microcontroller Selected: PIC18F47Q10</p> <p>Rationale:</p> <p>Adequate I/O: Sufficient GPIOs to handle all peripherals. Wireless Capabilities: n/a. My system was switched from using the esp32 to now PIC due to programming concerns. Low Power Consumption: Suitable for battery-powered weather monitoring applications. Strong Software Support: Compatible with ESP-IDF, Arduino, and MicroPython. Community and Documentation: Extensive online resources for troubleshooting and development.</p> <p>Next Steps</p> <p>Test I2C communication with the HDC1010YPAR sensor using PIC.

This selection ensures reliable performance and efficient integration with all sensors and peripherals. It is also highly compatible for the sensor part of the team\u2019s circuit. Due to the I2C communication, it may communicate with the PIC18F47Q10 and carry the same voltage 3.3V. I would need to use pull-up resistors around some parts of the sensor and ensure correct amperage using these sensors as well.</p> <p>Power Source &amp; Voltage Regulator Selection</p> <p>I need to ensure that this part receives the correct amperage. Due to the team planning to use 5V instead of 3.3V for this side of the circuit we then have two choices. These choices are to either use 3.3V for the whole board or to use an LDO, since it is a minimal change of 1.7V we hope that this LDO regulator may work in reducing the voltage running through my devices. I will have to construct a circuit that regualates the voltage similar to the voltage regulator lab we finished in class. | Solution                        | Pros                                      | Cons                              | |---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------| | LDO Regulator               |                                           |            | | AMS1117-3.3V     |Simple, Readily available, Low noise  |Higher heat dissipation       | |                                 |                                           |                       | | Switching Regulator         |                                         |                                       | | LM2596-3.3V                 |  High efficiency, Low heat generation |  Bulkier, Requires additional components  | | AP63203WU-7                 |  Outputs exactly 3.3V, Surface mount, High efficiency |  Requires precise PCB layout  |</p> <p>Rationale: The AP63203WU-7 was chosen for its precise 3.3V output, surface-mount form factor, and high efficiency, making it ideal for this embedded system.</p> <p>Conclusion This component selection ensures an efficient, low-power, and scalable design for a weather monitoring system using a PIC18F47Q10 and HDC1010YPAR temperature and humidity sensor.</p>"},{"location":"Schematic%20Design/","title":"Schematic Desgin","text":"<p>Below is the Humidity and Temperature subsystem created for Team 308, Fresh Start.
