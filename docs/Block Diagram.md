Below is the Humidity and Temperature subsystem created for Team 308, Fresh Start. 
The system uses the ESP 32 microcontroller and regulates the 9V using an LDO and a switch to start the device up.
It is the individual susbsystem, but in the future will need to use the same power source to charge other teamates systems.
The PCB will be made to be compact, and the only through holes on this PCB are planned to be the LDO and the barrel jack for power. We can get away with making the compacitors and resistors surface mount however we prefer through hole. In large scale industry surface mount has its benefits due to being compact and hightended durability.
