Below is the [block diagram](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/19I_488VRz9nsvQRNoa4jgeBesulI3tln). It is meant to give an overview of what components will be used in the system and how it may communicate with the teammates designs. In this block diagram, I wanted to detail how multiple perspectives where accounted for in the design of this humidity and temperature subsystem. 

Decision Making Process: For this Block Diagram we wanted to esnsure that all requirements for this class were met and at the same time that my team will be able to use the data from my sensor for their own purposes. In specific, the requirements that I had to meet can be defined but not limited to the following: surface mounted components (some components like fuse holder are excused for this purpose), 9V being regulated to exactly 3.3V (any more than this **will** result in the PIC18F47Q10 not programming, I2C communication from sensor, serial data from sensor being read by my teamates in the RX lines in UART ribbon cable. As seen in the block diagram, I also had a programming switch which is to show that the sensor is turned off and on at certain points. The GPIO pins are meant as a precaustion if any of this system is faulty and I needed to connect certain ports of my microcontroller to someone elses system to show the direct data being reeived from my microcontroller. At the end of the day these GPIO pins deemed to be cructial in my teamated actuator working as intended because the communication between the two had difficulties and these GPIO pins seemed to simplify the handling of information.
