Below is the Humidity and Temperature subsystem created for Team 308, Fresh Start. 
The system uses the ESP 32 microcontroller and regulates the 9V using an LDO and a switch to start the device up.
It is the individual susbsystem, but in the future will need to use the same power source to charge other teamates systems.
