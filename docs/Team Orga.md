Product mission statement:
---
Our mission is to design and deliver an innovative, user-friendly physical device that leverages cutting-edge embedded systems technology to enhance the daily lives of our users. We aim to create a product that not only meets the highest standards of quality and reliability but also provides exceptional value and satisfaction to our customers.

---
Context for mission statement:
---

Identify Core Values: Our team decided that the customers needs is the primary concern for this product creation, therefore we need to take into account the daily lives of our customers and communicate effectively to develop this product.

Define the Purpose: Since our customers are the top prioty in the product creation process we must declare what the purpose of the product is in order to create the best solution possible.

Outline Key Objectives: After communicating with our customer, we must must clearly outline the key objectives of our product and use the assets we our familiar with or even not if it is what is best for the customer in order to enhance the daily life of our user. Sometimes to create the best product we cannot use the best assets if the cost will be effected which takes into account why we must priotize certain areas of this product over other areas by creating the key objectives.

Use Clear and Concise Language: In order to communicate effetively we need to utilize language that would be understood by all in the products creation. This might be difficult as an engineer but is important while taking into account team effort and customer collaboration.

Test and Refine: Once our product is complete we must test the customers initial concerns and if our product could be used or enhanced in order to do it's job as intended.

Team Coordination & Accountability
---

Assignment Deadlines: Establish clear deadlines for each assignment and communicate them to all team members.

Progress Checkpoints: Implement intermediate checkpoints to review progress and ensure tasks are on track.
Final Review: Schedule a final review meeting before the submission deadline where each team member reviews and "signs off" on the assignment.

Knowledge and Skill Requirements: Conduct an initial assessment to identify each team member's strengths and areas for improvement. For this situation it will be a simple team interview. 

Training and Resources: Provide necessary training and resources to fill any knowledge gaps.

Mentorship: Pair less experienced members with mentors who can guide them through the assignment.

Feedback Distribution and Action: Use Google Drive  to collect and distribute feedback from design reviews.

Action Plan: Develop a clear action plan based on the feedback, assigning specific tasks to team members to address the feedback.

Follow-Up Meetings: Schedule follow-up meetings to ensure feedback has been acted upon and improvements have been made.
Addressing Missed Contributions and Accountability

Missed Contributions: Address missed contributions immediately through direct communication with the involved team member.

Root Cause Analysis: Identify the reasons for the missed contribution and provide support to resolve any issues.

Reassignment: If necessary, reassign tasks to ensure project continuity.

Accountability: Clearly define and communicate expectations for each team member.

Regular Check-Ins: Hold regular check-in meetings to monitor progress and address any issues early.

Peer Accountability: Encourage team members to hold each other accountable through open and respectful communication.

Recognizing and Addressing Underperformance: Regularly monitor each team member's performance against set expectations.

Support and Improvement Plan: If a team member is underperforming, provide constructive feedback and develop a support plan to help them improve.
