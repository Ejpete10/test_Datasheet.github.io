Below is the Humidity and Temperature subsystem created for Team 308, Fresh Start. 
The system uses the ESP 32 microcontroller and regulates the 9V using an LDO and a switch to start the device up.
It is the individual susbsystem, but in the future will need to use the same power source to charge other teamates systems.
The PCB will be made to be compact with surface mount applications being the focus of this design.
